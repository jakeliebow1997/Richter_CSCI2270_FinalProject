# Richter_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Data Structures Final Project

      I am working alone on this project. I aim to create a program that will allow me to easily check the quality of the ingredients in various cosmetic products. I would like to be able to copy and paste the list of ingredients directly from a web page into a user input that will be analyzed for any overlap of these elements with common comedogenic products or other additives which could adversely effect your skin. Then, instead of reading through 50,000 comments on Sephora.com to see if any person experienced a breakout because of a certain product, I can more immediately tell for myself whether or not this cosmetic item is more prone to affect my skin negatively. Most of the ingredients lists are separated by commas, so I will parse the list this way and compare the elements to pre-made lists of alphabetically-sorted, known comedogenic products. It would also be a future goal to allow for some customization of skin-type, say you have particularly oily skin and could set up that profile for yourself before analyzing ingredients, thereby further tailoring the results of what could potentially be bad for your skin.
